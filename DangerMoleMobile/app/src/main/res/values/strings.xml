        Danger Mole is an app conceived and developed by MSU Denver students as a solution to early detection of melanoma in nevi (moles).
        Danger Mole is designed to run on android and makes use of TensorFlow’s powerful machine learning libraries.
        The model itself is trained on data acquired from the International Skin Imaging Collaboration (ISIC) database which can be found at:
        https://www.isic-archive.com/#!/topWithHeader/wideContentTop/main
        Our team is composed of four undergraduates in pursuit of a BS in computer science.
        The project is currently in development as of spring 2019 and is intended as a prototype and not a definitive medical resource.

    <string name="general_info_text">
        Melanocytic Nevi are a subcategory of melanocytic tumors containing nevus cells.
        While the majority of moles are benign, it is important to regularly check your moles for changes in shape,
        texture, symmetry and color as these are signs of melanoma. Danger Mole uses these metrics to gauge the
        overall health of the mole by analyzing it against a trained neural network using TensorFlow’s framework.
        Further resources on melanoma can be found at the official dot gov site:
