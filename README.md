Project details.
Nevi (moles) are common anomolies of the skin and are composed of the same cells responsible for producing pigment.
Moles are a concern as they have the potential to become the site of melanoma, a common cancer of the skin.

Green group is developing an application to detect whether a nevus is progressing into melanoma using readily available 
technologies to the public.
